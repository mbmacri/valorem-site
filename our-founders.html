                            <h3>Natacha Giai – Finance Executive | Global Controller | Advisor</h3>
                            <h4>Leadership Journey</h4>
                            <p>With over 25 years of global experience, my career as a Finance Executive has spanned Big
                                4 firms, Fortune 500 companies, and high-growth technology startups. Across these
                                diverse environments, I’ve developed deep expertise in optimizing accounting operations
                                to drive greater efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.
                            </p>
                            <p>I am known for my hands-on leadership style and a strong commitment to building
                                high-performing, diverse finance teams—particularly in organizations navigating rapid
                                growth and transformation. I take pride in identifying meaningful opportunities for
                                process improvement, talent development, and operational excellence, ensuring that each
                                role is matched with the right capabilities to deliver lasting impact.
                            </p>
                            <p>Holding CPA certifications in both the U.S. and Argentina, I bring a global perspective
                                that allows me to 'translate' complex financial challenges into clear, actionable
                                strategies.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Passions & Priorities</h4>
                            <p>
                                Beyond helping companies build a strong Finance foundation, I enjoy spending time with
                                myhusband, two teenage boys (who keep us busy on and off the basketball court), and our
                                pets. Travel is a passion—it lets me experience new cultures and gain perspectives I
                                bring back to my work.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Teaching and mentorship have also been meaningful parts of my journey. I’ve had the
                                privilege of serving as a college professor, and I continue to enjoy guiding others as
                                they develop in their careers. I find real purpose in helping people grow, whether in
                                the classroom or within the workplace. And as a lifelong sports enthusiast—especially
                                when it comes to soccer—I’m already counting down to the 2026 World Cup.

                            <h3>Antonio Aponte – AI Thought Leader | Ex-EY Partner & CAO | Investor | Advisor | Coach
                            </h3>
                            <h4>Leadership Journey</h4>
                            <p>My time at EY provided immeasurable training and a strong foundation in leadership,
                                client service, and strategic advisory. During my tenure, I focused on working with
                                dynamic, high-growth companies to be a trusted partner and strategic advisor.</p>
                            <p>I made the deliberate decision to leave the Partnership to become an operator and broaden
                                my perspective as a hands-on, well-rounded leader. This transition has reframed my
                                entire mindset and approach to be a better well-rounded client serving professional.
                            </p>
                            <p>I have a continuous improvement mindset and thoroughly enjoy learning. I’ve invested
                                significant time to gain an in-depth understanding of the complex landscape of AI
                                powered finance solutions. This has framed my understanding of what great should look
                                like across technology, process and people within finance.</p>

                            <h4>Passions & Priorities</h4>
                            <p>Above all, family is my top priority. Celebrating 15 years of marriage and having 2
                                active kids keeps us busy and equally inspired. I have been a coach for a number of our
                                kids' sports teams and I love seeing their progression through the ranks within Mixed
                                Martial Arts (MMA). I share their passion for Martial Arts and appreciate the valuable
                                life lessons we have all learned as a result.</p>
                            <p>As a family, we love to travel and immerse ourselves in new cultures—it’s a shared
                                passion that keeps us curious and connected. This connection extends to building
                                relationships with genuine, purpose-driven people, both personally and professionally. I
                                have been fortunate to serve on various NFP Boards focused on supporting underserved
                                communities. Doing our part to help others is a shared family passion as we have
                                fostered nearly a dozen animals. This keeps us all grounded and focused on what truly
                                matters at the end of the day. </p>
