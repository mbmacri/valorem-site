                            <h3>Natacha Giai – Finance Executive | Global Controller | Advisor</h3>
                            <h4>Who I Am</h4>
                            <p>I am a Finance Executive with over 25 years of experience across big 4s, Fortune 500s and
                                high-growth technology startups. As a dual CPA (US & Argentina), I bring global
                                expertise and hands-on leadership to build Finance organizations that scale with growth.
                                I am passionate about building—whether it’s high-performing teams, scalable processes,
                                or Finance systems that support rapid change. My focus is on making Finance a strategic
                                partner by turning complexity into clarity and creating infrastructures that help
                                businesses grow smarter.</p>
                            <h4>What I Love Doing</h4>
                            <p>Beyond helping startups build a strong Finance foundation, I enjoy spending time with my
                                husband, two teenage boys, and our pets. Travel is a passion—it lets me experience new
                                cultures and gain perspectives I bring back to my work. I’m also passionate about
                                building diverse teams, believing that different experiences drive stronger outcomes.
                                Teaching has been part of my journey as well; I’ve been a college professor and enjoy
                                mentoring others as they grow. And when it comes to sports, I’m a lifelong soccer fan,
                                already counting down to the 2026 World Cup.</p>

                            <h4>Who I Am</h4>
                            <p>Ex Big 4 partner with operational know-how. I received incredible training and global
                                experiences from my time spent at a big 4 firm, which is now partnered with invaluable
                                hands-on experience as an operator. This has completely reframed my entire mindset and
                                approach to be a better and well-rounded client serving professional. I have an
                                insatiable desire for continuous improvement and learning. I have spent a significant
                                amount of time gaining an in-depth understanding of AI powered finance solutions to
                                truly understand what great should look like across technology, process and people for
                                finance teams.</p>
                            <h4>What I Love Doing</h4>
                            <p>Family is and will always be first for me. Recently, we celebrated 15 years of marriage
                                and I have two kids that are very active and provide us with the utmost joy. Our family
                                passion is traveling, seeing the world and learning new cultures. I approach business
                                similar to how I approach life, I value interacting with genuinely good people. Lastly,
                                I have an incredible passion for self-improvement and helping underserved communities in
                                all facets of life. I have served on various NFP boards and most recently we have
                                fostered various animals in our home. This is a family passion and helps keep us all
                                grounded on what really matters at the end of the day.</p>
