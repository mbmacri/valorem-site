                            <h4>Who I Am</h4>
                            <p>Ex Big 4 partner with operational know-how.  I received incredible training and global experiences from my time spent at a big 4 firm, which is now partnered with invaluable hands-on experience as an operator.  This has completely reframed my entire mindset and approach to be a better and well-rounded client serving professional.  I have an insatiable desire for continuous improvement and learning.  I have spent a significant amount of time gaining an in-depth understanding of AI powered finance solutions to truly understand what great should look like across technology, process and people for finance teams.</p>
                            <h4>What I Love Doing</h4>
                            <p>Family is and will always be first for me.  Recently, we celebrated 15 years of marriage and I have two kids that are very active and provide us with the utmost joy.  Our family passion is traveling, seeing the world and learning new cultures.  I approach business similar to how I approach life, I value interacting with genuinely good people.  Lastly, I have an incredible passion for self-improvement and helping underserved communities in all facets of life.  I have served on various NFP boards and most recently we have fostered various animals in our home.  This is a family passion and helps keep us all grounded on what really matters at the end of the day.</p>
